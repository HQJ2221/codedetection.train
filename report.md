> For the dataset of `Brcode-qrcode-kuihuama Repo`: It's a combination of multiple 1D barcode/QR code datasets collected by [simplew2011](https://github.com/simplew2011), and one of its reference is [BenSouchet/barcode-datasets](https://github.com/BenSouchet/barcode-datasets) which include many popular 1D Barcode dataset(e.g. `InventBar`, `ParcelBar`, `SBD`, `Muenster BarcodeDB`)
>
> We only selected part of them to apply in our training and testing.



## Source

- We find most of our image data from:
  - [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/)
  - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
  - [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)



## Development Guide

### Dataset form

- we originate dataset as:

```
# [image_path] [width] [height] [cls]
[src_X] [src_Y] [dst_X] [dst_Y]
```

- following modification should be done:
  - [x] delete `kps` data
  - [ ] make `cls` target-specified other than image-specified
- we hope finally our dataset like this:

```
# [image_path] [width] [height]
[src_X] [src_Y] [dst_X] [dst_Y] [cls] /* one target */
[src_X] [src_Y] [dst_X] [dst_Y] [cls] /* if exists multi-target */
```
